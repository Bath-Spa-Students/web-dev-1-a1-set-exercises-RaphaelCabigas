                    She is a petite, female Elf with green eyes and long white hair tied into two
                    pigtails. Like all Elves, she has large, pointed ears. She wears a striped black and white
                    shirt,
                    along with a
                    white jacket with gold embellishments tucked into a matching skirt with a black belt. Over her
                    jacket, she
                    wears a short white and gold cape with a high collar. She also wears black tights and brown
                    boots,
                    and a pair
                    of gold and red earrings.

                    He was a male Human with blue hair and a mole near his left eye. His eyes were light blue.
                    He
                    was
                    self-declared to be handsome, and took great care of his appearance, even in old age. Himmel
                    wore a
                    long
                    beige cloak that drapes down to his ankles, a fitted blue tunic, white pants, and black boots.
                    Around
                    his
                    waist, he wore a white belt which contrasted with the blue fabric of his tunic.

                    He was a rather tall and bespectacled Priest with short green hair that he kept slicked
                    back.
                    Two strands of his hair flew loose over his forehead. Similar to most priests, Heiter carried a
                    book
                    of
                    scriptures, and he wore a long, black robe with gold trims and accents. Underneath his robe,
                    Heiter
                    wore
                    a
                    long black shirt with a white top and gold accents, a gold belt, and a black-and-gold collar
                    alongside
                    black
                    pants and shoes.
