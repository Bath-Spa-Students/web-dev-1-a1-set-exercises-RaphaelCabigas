        <p class="long-description">
        <p class="long-description">The story follows elven mage Frieren, a former member of the party of
            adventurers who defeated the Demon
            King and restored harmony to the world after a ten-year quest. In the past, the heroic group included
            Frieren, human hero Himmel, dwarven warrior Eisen, and human priest Heiter. Before they part, they
            observe the Era Meteors together, a meteor shower that occurs once in fifty years. Frieren agrees to see
            them again and offers them a better view the next time the celestial event occurs. Frieren then departs
            and travels the world in pursuit of magical knowledge.
            Frieren returns to the capital fifty years later;
            however, humanity has changed, and her former companions have distinctly aged. After one last adventure
            to see the meteor shower, Himmel dies of old age. During the funeral, Frieren expressed guilt for not
            attempting to learn more about him. Frieren then pays a visit to her other former comrades. She accepts
            an offer to teach and care for Fern, an orphaned child adopted by Heiter. She also receives an
            invitation to travel far north, to the resting place of souls, and see Himmel again to bid the hero a
            fitting farewell and express her feelings. To fulfill those requests, Frieren embarks on a journey
            together with Fern while still pursuing her passion for learning magic. Along the way, she picks up
            Stark, a young warrior boy taught by Eisen, to join her party.
            Frieren's elven nature grants her an extremely long lifespan, causing her to view periods of years or
            decades as ephemeral (this perception of time makes her consider the ten-year adventure with Himmel's
            party a fleeting experience). The story thus takes place across a long time, with periodic flashbacks
            accompanied by the physical and mental development of characters apart from Frieren herself.
