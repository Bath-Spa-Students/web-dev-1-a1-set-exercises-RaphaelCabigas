        <p class="long-description">Katsuma Ogura, the editor-in-charge of Frieren, noted that Yamada's previous
            work, Bocchi Hakase to Robot
            Shoujo no Zetsubou Teki Utopia, did not sell well, despite considering it a masterpiece. This led to the
            suggestion of giving Yamada an illustrator for Frieren. They had several thoughts that went from a gag
            manga which resulted in storyboards for a one-shot of Frieren. Upon reading the one-shot of Frieren,
            Ogura started laughing, claiming that it was not a comedy at all. When Yamada finished the first
            storyboard, before sending it to the editorial department, Ogura contacted Abe and asked them to draw a
            character chart. Yamada was impressed with it and Ogura asked him do it, submitting the project to the
            editorial. Ogura was impressed with Abe's artwork and suggested that he work with Yamada. Yamada was
            impressed with the first illustration of Frieren, believing the title character had an aura of humanity.
            After Kanehito Yamada, who was in charge of the original work, finished serializing his previous work,
            "Since it was a comedy about demons, I suggested that they try writing a gag in that direction, and
            suddenly the name of the first chapter of Funeral Frieren" came up. After that, he decided to hire
            someone to be in charge of drawing, and when he showed his name to Tsukasa Abe, who was also in charge,
            he responded, "I'd like to draw it." When I asked him to draw a character picture for Frieren, Yamada
            said, "If this is the person, please do it." Abe was put in charge of the animation.
            The origin of the title of this work is that Yamada had a title idea, but the editorial department also
            considered it, and at the editorial department meeting, the editor in charge said, "If we decide on a
            good title, we will pay a prize of 10,000 yen out of our own pocket." One of the title ideas submitted
            by the deputy editor-in-chief was Funeral Frieren, and Yamada and Abe finally decided on the title,
            which became the current title.
            For the animated adaptation by Madhouse, Tomohiro Suzuki said Fern's character was too different
            depending on who she is interacting with; with Frieren there is a motherly bond while in front of Stark,
            she acts like a childish normal teenager. Director Keiichiro Saito added that Fern appears to have
            several changes in the narrative as her growth has a major impact on Frieren. When it comes to Stark,
            Suzuki says that despite being a coward, he is still written to be handsome and cool and has a major
            impact on Fern as he becomes the first young male friend she has ever met and socialized in her entire
            life.
