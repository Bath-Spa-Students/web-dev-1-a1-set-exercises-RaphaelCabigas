            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <p class="long-description">Frieren: Beyond Journey's End is a Japanese manga series written by Kanehito
                Yamada and illustrated by
                Tsukasa Abe. It has been serialized in Shogakukan's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Sunday since
                April 2020, with its chapters collected in 12 tankōbon volumes as of December 2023. The series is
                licensed for English release in North America by Viz Media. An anime television series adaptation
                produced by Madhouse aired from September 2023 to March 2024. Crunchyroll has licensed and distributed
                the series in North America, Europe, and Australia, with an English dub premiering the following month,
                and Muse Communication licensing the series in Southeast Asia.
                Taking place in a fantasy world, the story follows Frieren, an elven mage, as she embarks on a journey
                to reach the resting place of souls in order to reunite with her former comrade Himmel, whose Hero Party
                once slew the Demon King.
                By March 2024, the manga had over 20 million copies in circulation. Frieren: Beyond Journey's End won
                the 14th Manga Taishō and the New Creator Prize of the 25th annual Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize in 2021
                and the 69th Shogakukan Manga Award in 2024.
                A role-playing video game is in development at Netmarble.

            <h2>PLOT</h2>
            <p class="long-description">The story follows elven mage Frieren, a former member of the party of
                adventurers who defeated the Demon
                King and restored harmony to the world after a ten-year quest. In the past, the heroic group included
                Frieren, human hero Himmel, dwarven warrior Eisen, and human priest Heiter. Before they part, they
                observe the Era Meteors together, a meteor shower that occurs once in fifty years. Frieren agrees to see
                them again and offers them a better view the next time the celestial event occurs. Frieren then departs
                and travels the world in pursuit of magical knowledge.
                Frieren returns to the capital fifty years later;
                however, humanity has changed, and her former companions have distinctly aged. After one last adventure
                to see the meteor shower, Himmel dies of old age. During the funeral, Frieren expressed guilt for not
                attempting to learn more about him. Frieren then pays a visit to her other former comrades. She accepts
                an offer to teach and care for Fern, an orphaned child adopted by Heiter. She also receives an
                invitation to travel far north, to the resting place of souls, and see Himmel again to bid the hero a
                fitting farewell and express her feelings. To fulfill those requests, Frieren embarks on a journey
                together with Fern while still pursuing her passion for learning magic. Along the way, she picks up
                Stark, a young warrior boy taught by Eisen, to join her party.
                Frieren's elven nature grants her an extremely long lifespan, causing her to view periods of years or
                decades as ephemeral (this perception of time makes her consider the ten-year adventure with Himmel's
                party a fleeting experience). The story thus takes place across a long time, with periodic flashbacks
                accompanied by the physical and mental development of characters apart from Frieren herself.

                        was
                        self-declared to be handsome, and took great care of his appearance, even in old age. Himmel
                        wore a
                        long
                        beige cloak that drapes down to his ankles, a fitted blue tunic, white pants, and black boots.

                        his
                        waist, he wore a white belt which contrasted with the blue fabric of his tunic.

                        back.
                        Two strands of his hair flew loose over his forehead. Similar to most priests, Heiter carried a
                        book
                        of
                        scriptures, and he wore a long, black robe with gold trims and accents. Underneath his robe,

                        wore

                        with a nose guard. Eisen wears a red cape with armor on his shoulders and a brown tunic

            <h2>PRODUCTION</h2>
            <p class="long-description">Katsuma Ogura, the editor-in-charge of Frieren, noted that Yamada's previous
                work, Bocchi Hakase to Robot
                Shoujo no Zetsubou Teki Utopia, did not sell well, despite considering it a masterpiece. This led to the
                suggestion of giving Yamada an illustrator for Frieren. They had several thoughts that went from a gag
                manga which resulted in storyboards for a one-shot of Frieren. Upon reading the one-shot of Frieren,
                Ogura started laughing, claiming that it was not a comedy at all. When Yamada finished the first
                storyboard, before sending it to the editorial department, Ogura contacted Abe and asked them to draw a
                character chart. Yamada was impressed with it and Ogura asked him do it, submitting the project to the
                editorial. Ogura was impressed with Abe's artwork and suggested that he work with Yamada. Yamada was
                impressed with the first illustration of Frieren, believing the title character had an aura of humanity.
                After Kanehito Yamada, who was in charge of the original work, finished serializing his previous work,
                "Since it was a comedy about demons, I suggested that they try writing a gag in that direction, and
                suddenly the name of the first chapter of Funeral Frieren" came up. After that, he decided to hire
                someone to be in charge of drawing, and when he showed his name to Tsukasa Abe, who was also in charge,
                he responded, "I'd like to draw it." When I asked him to draw a character picture for Frieren, Yamada
                said, "If this is the person, please do it." Abe was put in charge of the animation.
                The origin of the title of this work is that Yamada had a title idea, but the editorial department also
                considered it, and at the editorial department meeting, the editor in charge said, "If we decide on a
                good title, we will pay a prize of 10,000 yen out of our own pocket." One of the title ideas submitted
                by the deputy editor-in-chief was Funeral Frieren, and Yamada and Abe finally decided on the title,
                which became the current title.
                For the animated adaptation by Madhouse, Tomohiro Suzuki said Fern's character was too different
                depending on who she is interacting with; with Frieren there is a motherly bond while in front of Stark,
                she acts like a childish normal teenager. Director Keiichiro Saito added that Fern appears to have
                several changes in the narrative as her growth has a major impact on Frieren. When it comes to Stark,
                Suzuki says that despite being a coward, he is still written to be handsome and cool and has a major
                impact on Fern as he becomes the first young male friend she has ever met and socialized in her entire
                life.
